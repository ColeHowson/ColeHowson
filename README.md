### Welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Cole Howson and I am a Data Analyst based in Toronto Ontario.

As a Data Analyst, I use my knowledge of SQL, Tableau, and Python, along with creativity and resourceful analytical skills to extract actionable insights. 

I am very passionate about Hockey and Chess, and also enjoy composing, mixing and releasing original music.

Before my journey in Data Analytics, I was the store manager of one of the top butcher shops in Toronto(Sanaganâ€™s Meat Locker Gerrard) where I learned what it takes to lead a successful team. 
 
If I am not digging through data sets, you can find me in the kitchen trying a new recipe or walking around Toronto with my Boston Terrier, Pepper. 

For any questions or inquires, please don't hesitate to send me a email! colehowson@gmail.com
